# PD-Modelling
In this notebook, I have tried to depict the procedure for one year PD modelling.
For now it is incomplete.


The procedure for modelling One year Probability of Default in this notebook is heavily influnced by Chapter-2 of Tiziano Bellini book,IFRS 9 and CECL Credit Risk Modelling and Validation.
Code for stepwise regression is taken by stepwise-regression package by Aakkash Vijaya kumar.
